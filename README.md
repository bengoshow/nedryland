My collection of dotfiles, scripts, and themes that I find handy.

## What is "Nedryland"?

If you don't already know, I'm a [pretty massive fan of Jurassic Park][Jordan and Jurassic Park]. Nedryland is the name of the program [Dennis Nedry] made for running and interacting with the [Jurassic Park Control System]. The theme colors picked out for the Slack and iTerm2 are based on the color scheme used both in Nedryland and the breaker colors in the maintenance shed.
